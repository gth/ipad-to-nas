# Windows Powershell Script to move a set of files (based on a filter) from a folder
# on an MTP device (e.g. Android phone) to a folder on a computer, using the Windows Shell.
# By Daiyan Yingyu, 19 March 2018, based on the (non-working) script found here:
#   https://www.pstips.net/access-file-system-against-mtp-connection.html
# as referenced here:

# This Powershell script is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
# In no event will the author be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this script.
#
# Again, please note that used 'as-is' this script will MOVE files from you phone:
# the files will be DELETED from the source (the phone) and MOVED to the computer.
#
# If you want to copy files instead, you can replace the MoveHere function call with "CopyHere" instead.
# But once again, I can take any responsibility for the use, or misuse, of this script.
